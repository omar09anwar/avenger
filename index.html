            <p>Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. Landfills collect <br>
               garbage and other land pollution in a central location. Many places are running out of <br>
               space for landfills.</p>

                <p>Air pollution is the release of gases and small fragments of human-made particles and chemicals into the air, the concentration of which is harmful to all living and breathing creatures on this planet. Upon studying global warming, researchers have determined that air pollution is a significant contributor to this problem.</p>

                <p>Water is one of the basic necessities of life. Though about three-fourths of the Earth surface covers with water bodies, but the availability of fresh water to us is of a serious issue. Water pollution is another main type of pollution. It gets polluted when harmful substances enter the water bodies or seep down the water table. It has the unique feature of dissolving many substances. Dissolved gases like oxygen are essential for aquatic life.</p>

                <p>Among the many other types of pollution, soil pollution or land pollution is the next one. Soil is one of the important natural resources. The soil provides shelter to many animals and supports the growth of plants from which we obtain our basic needs. Soil also gets harmful and polluted when some harmful substances mix with the soil.</p>

                <p>Noise is an unwanted sound in our environment. This causes adverse effects on humans. It has penetrated deep in the modern life due to development of industry, machinery and technologies. Noise disturbs the tranquillity of human life. Loud sounds and noises are caused in factories, roads, by aeroplanes or in marketplaces. Sound intensities are measured in the unit named as decibels (dB). For our system, sound beyond 80 dB causes noise pollution.</p>

                <p>To reduce noise pollution, we need to take certain actions. Use of loudspeakers during the late night and early morning must not be done and also maintain the low sound intensity during any time of the day. Unnecessary use of horns should be restricted. Vehicles should use proper silencers. The noisy vehicles should not be allowed to enter the residential premises. Thick glass panes in the windows cut down the noise pollution to a larger extent. Trees absorb noises, so planting trees help to reduce the extent of noise pollution.</p>
